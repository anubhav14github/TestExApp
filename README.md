# TestExApp
A MEAN Stack WEB based application using REST API
It is an Online Testing platform for creating,viewing and solving MCQ based questions.

#Technlogy used:
1) Use of Mongoose(ODM for MONGODB) and nodejs,expressjs for Backend development.
2) Use of Angular framework for frontend development.

#what one can learn or understand from this project
#Backend features:
1) Application of Routing, controller functions, middlewares with async-await to get better understanding of asyncronous programming.
2) Application of Models for defining schemas of documents and how to write various types of queries in mongoose to find/save/update/delete document.
3) Writing APIs for different objectives for eg: User registration and login with proper error handling and validation.

#frontend Features:
(I'm hoping that you atleast understand file structure and basics of Angular)
1) Use of TypeScript with Angular for handling various tasks.
2) Services, its uses and implementation.
3) frontend and backend connection using services.
4) application of App routing, component-wise segregation 

#some of the key Features:
1) Backend development with nodejs,expressjs. How to create models, controllers, middlewares and write APIs.
2) how to call backend APIs from frontend and handling callbacks with the help of services and use of LocalStorage(which i generally not recommend,instead you can use webStorage or cookies)for handling user sessions in frontend.

#some of the drawbacks:
1) frontend validation.(might not have covered much in this section,might have some bugs.)
2) Backend Authentication with jwt Token.(will cover this shortly).
